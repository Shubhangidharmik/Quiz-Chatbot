# Quiz-Chatbot
A quiz chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to engage users in quiz-like interactions through a chat interface. It combines the elements of a chatbot and a quiz game, allowing users to interact with the chatbot by answering questions and receiving feedback on their responses.

## Here's how a typical quiz chatbot works:
1. Asking Questions: The chatbot asks the user a series of questions on different topics.
2. User Input: The user provides their answers to the questions by typing them in the chat.
3. Answer Validation: The chatbot validates the user's answers against the correct answers it has in its database.
4. Feedback: The chatbot provides feedback to the user, letting them know if their answer was correct or incorrect.
5. Scoring: The chatbot keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz.
6. Completion: Once all the questions have been asked, the chatbot ends the quiz and displays the user's final score.
